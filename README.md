To create an Instagram layout using HTML and CSS, start by creating a container div for the entire layout. Add a header div for the logo, search bar, and profile info. Create a content div for the post image, info, caption, and comments. Use CSS to style elements and flexbox to align them. With these steps, you can create a functional Instagram layout.
